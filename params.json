I've used this on several client projects in the past, so decided to let it out into the wild! Feel free to use or modify as you wish.\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n\r\n- Sliding carousel\r\n- Prev/Next buttons & keyboard arrow carousel controls\r\n- Lightbox-like image enlargement\r\n- Image captions\r\n- Barebones styling to make it super easy to insert into your own design\r\n\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n========\r\n\r\n## 1. Reference jQuery & the Slidebox library\r\n\r\n## 2. Initialize slidebox\r\n\r\nSlidebox needs to be initialized, either in ```<script>``` tags at the bottom of your HTML, or in a separate JavaScript file, like so:\r\n\r\n\t\tslidebox({\r\n            container : \".carousel-cont\",\r\n            leftTrigger : \".carousel-left\",\r\n            rightTrigger : \".carousel-right\",\r\n            speed : \"fast\",\r\n            length : \"200\"\r\n        });\r\n\r\n### Parameters\r\n\r\n#### Slidebox currently accepts only five parameters.##\r\n\r\n**container**\r\nThe div containing the ```.carousel``` unordered list.\r\n\r\n**leftTrigger**\r\nThe element to show previous items.\r\n\r\n**rightTrigger**\r\nThe element to show next items.\r\n\r\n**speed**\r\nHow fast it slides.\r\n\r\n**length**\r\nThe amount (in pixels) it slides left or right at a time. Usually equal to the width of the images, if they're a consistent width.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## 3. Mark it up\r\n\r\nFor the slider to work, it requires an unordered list with a class of ```.carousel``` and a containing element with a class of whatever you'd like (```.carousel-cont``` is what I like to use). This containing element is what needs to be passed in to the ```container``` object.\r\n\r\nThe lightbox portion of the plugin uses the source of the anchors in each list item as the enlarged source image. Captions can easily be added using the ```data-caption``` attribute. So the markup should look something like this:\r\n\r\n\t\t<div class=\"carousel-left\">Prev</div>\r\n\t    <div class=\"carousel-right\">Next</div>\r\n\t        \r\n        <div class=\"carousel-cont\">\r\n            <ul class=\"carousel\">\r\n                <li>\r\n                    <a href=\"http://lorempixel.com/800/500\">\r\n                        <img src=\"http://lorempixel.com/200/150\" data-caption=\"This is a caption\">\r\n                    </a>\r\n                </li>\r\n                <li>\r\n                    <a href=\"http://placekitten.com/800/650\">\r\n                        <img src=\"http://placekitten.com/200/150\" data-caption=\"This is another caption\">\r\n                    </a>\r\n                </li>\r\n                <li>\r\n                    <a href=\"http://placesheen.com/825/1200\">\r\n                        <img src=\"http://placesheen.com/200/150\" data-caption=\"This is a caption\">\r\n                    </a>\r\n                </li>\r\n            </ul>\r\n        </div>\r\n\r\n## 4. Styling\r\n\r\nI've purposely left out any skinning, as this is meant to fit into multiple layouts and contexts. However, the few styles that are in ```/demo/style.css``` are needed for everything to work. You can tweak as desired. The CSS is barebones so it should fit seamlessly into any layouts, responsive or static, with a little of your own touch.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
